        <p>Hello my name is Abdirahman Diriye but most people call me Abdi. My family is
             from somalia but I was born in kampala uganda because my family was fleeing 
             the civil war in somalia. We shortly moved to the United States when I was 5 years old.</p>
        
         <p>My hobbies consist of playing and watching sports. My favorite two sports are basketball and football. I also 
           enjoy coding and also challenging myself thats why this Coding bootcamp was so intriquing to me.
         </p>
